# TorontoHousingShelters

Homelessness is an important issue in our society and I believe there should be more resources available to cope with their situation and in turn have a strong platform to get back on their feet.

Toronto open data website makes available the daily updated data for information regarding the occupancies of the homeless shelters in Toronto area.

This is my attempt to make a working website using their API to provide daily information on where they can find the available shelters with available occupancy.
